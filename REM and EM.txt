Both EM and REM represent relative units that display the 
scalable and responsive results.

EM : It is the relative to the font size of the parent.
    EG : If a parent font size is 20px then 2em is 40px
REM : It is relative to the root element font size, usually 
      <html>.
    EG : If the root font is 16px then 1rem is 16px.
